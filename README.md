# ‚úàÔ∏è AircraftTracker

## Overview
**AircraftTracker** is a database-driven application for managing the **maintenance, operations, and assignments of military aircraft and crews**.  
The system is designed to support decision-making in aviation by keeping detailed records of:
- Aircraft models and categories
- Maintenance and repair history
- Squadron and crew assignments
- Mission performance and outcomes
- Damage assessments and repair planning
- Homebase management and logistics

While initially scoped for **WW2 fighter and bomber aircraft**, the design can be adapted for modern military or commercial aviation contexts.

## üìä Domain Modeling
The database models the following key aspects of the aviation domain:

- **Aircraft Management** ‚Äì Categorization of aircraft by type, model, and service history.  
- **Maintenance** ‚Äì Tracking repairs, upgrades, downtime, and performed tasks.  
- **Squadron & Crew** ‚Äì Assigning pilots and crew to squadrons, monitoring ranks, and mission roles.  
- **Operations** ‚Äì Documenting missions with dates, locations, aircraft, and crew involvement.  
- **Damage Assessment** ‚Äì Recording and categorizing damages, parts affected, and operational readiness.  
- **Homebase Management** ‚Äì Assigning squadrons to bases and managing logistical resources.

## üöÄ Functionality
The database and application provide the following capabilities:

- Track aircraft registry and maintenance history.  
- Record damages and categorize by affected systems and operational status.  
- Assign and manage crew members for missions.  
- Generate insights, such as:
  - Survival rates of experienced vs. inexperienced crews.  
  - Aircraft vulnerability to specific types of damage.  
  - Predictions of remaining lifespan of aircraft based on hours, damages, and maintenance.  
- Support repair/retirement decisions with structured reports.
